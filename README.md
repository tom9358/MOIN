# MOIN - Mapping Orthographies Involving NLP
A transliterator between Gronings, Ostfriesisch Platt (in SASS and/or jungfräisk spelling) and the NSS spelling would slap


## Project Description
MOIN is an ongoing project dedicated to developing a transliterator for various Low German (Plattdüütsch) orthographies. The primary goal is to create a tool that can convert text between different spelling conventions, such as the traditional Gronings spelling, the German SASS spelling, the Nysassiske Skryvwyse (NSS), and the Jungfräiske Mäinskup East Frisian spelling. This aims to facilitate interoperability, linguistic analysis, and wider accessibility for texts written in different regional spellings of Low German.


## Project Structure
-   `src/`: Contains the core Python scripts for transliteration.
-   `data/`: Stores relevant data files used by the scripts.

## Future Development
-   **Expanded Rule Sets**: Implement comprehensive transliteration rules for full and accurate conversion between Gronings, SASS, NSS, and Jungfräisk.
-   **Multidirectional Conversion**: Support transliteration in all directions between the supported orthographies.
-   **Robust Text Processing**: Improve handling of punctuation, capitalization, and edge cases.
-   **User Interface**: Explore developing a simple command-line interface or a web interface for easier use.
-   **Integration of NLP Techniques**: Investigate using advanced NLP methods for more nuanced and context-aware transliteration, especially for ambiguous cases or irregular forms. Perhaps some Seq2Seq models could be used here.
-   **Comprehensive Testing**: Develop a suite of tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the transliteration rules.
-   **The Sky is the Limit**: Explore exploring the potential of using machine learning models to predict and correct errors in transliteration, and explore extending the project by venturing into more complex linguistic analysis and machine learning applications, such as Machine Translation.

## Contributing
Contributions are highly encouraged! If you're interested in improving the transliteration rules, adding support for new dialects, contributing to the codebase, or suggesting new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you for your interest in this project! You deserve to know that this text was generated by generative artificial intelligence, although it was significantly adapted by a human to ensure quality and accuracy.
